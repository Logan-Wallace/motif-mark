'''The purpose of this program is to generate a drawing of a sequence displaying a gene (line), an 
exon (rectangle) and motifs (hash marks) along the gene by reading in a fasta file holding a gene 
sequence and another text file containing motifs 
Using Pycairo and object oriented programming'''


# 1. Read in the fasta file. Use online fasta to turn the sequences from each gene into a single string
# Following the ">" character, we take the characters until a " " as the gene name.
# The characters after ":" need to be stored as the start and stop positions of the gene.
# If (reverse complement) is passed following this, we need to use reverse
# This should probably be a function of class 'gene'
